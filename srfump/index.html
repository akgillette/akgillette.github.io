(##) Episode 21: What do you know about dinosaurs?

In preparation for our upcoming new season, we interview our fellow family member
Austin about some of his favorite topics including animals, food, and books.
We are reminded of a sound that co-host Sierra heard once that was 
memorably spooky.  We also hear some valiant efforts at counting from Austin.
Chat with you more in the new season!
