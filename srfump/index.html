Episode 2: Can a princess be a scientist?
===============================================================================
Today we answer a plethora of questions submitted by listeners, 
  leading to discussions of the etymology of the word "unicorn", techniques 
  for identifying spooky mermaids, and the fascinating interplay between 
  caterpillars and flowers.  Host Sierra also reads questions from non-imaginary 
  friends of the show Quia and Salia, received on her fully functional, 
  decades-old flip phone. Send us your questions by your preferred method of 
  communication and we'll answer them, too!
