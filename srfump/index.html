(##) Episode 11: What does a witch's laugh sound like?

Join us --- if you dare --- for the Spooky Witchy Ghosty Spidery Haunted Halloween Podcast.
Co-host Sierra gives a very detailed retelling of three spooky books we've been reading recently: 
"Room on the Broom" by Julia Donaldson, "Sheep Trick or Treat" by Nancy Shaw,
 and "The Little Ghost Who Was a Quilt" by Riel Nason.  Afterwards we float through a number of 
 spooky topics based on our listeners' questions, 
 touching on the opacity of ghosts, the best time of day to spot flying witches, 
 and the origin of Halloween decorations.  Happy Halloween to you and yours!

With summer coming to a close, we field a few quesitons from listeners before gearing up
 for the spookiest time of year.  We discuss groups of unicorns and the sharpness of their horns, 
 memaid bathing techniques, and the many halves of moons.
 Host Sierra tells us a spooky story about a factory where ghosts make markers and explains 
 how to identify different kinds of fairies.  Send us your spooky questions or stories - we 
 are dying to hear them!

  jellyfish taxonomy, and amphibious unicorns.  Stay tuned at the end of the episode
  for a helpful jingle that can help you remember the days of the week!

 all kinds of homonyms, including spooky and Spanish ones.  With summer upon us, we review safety 
 tips and rules for when you're around the pool or out in the sun.  We compare teaching in a school
 to teaching swimming and learn from host Sierra how to say goodbye in a "spooky, beautiful" language.
